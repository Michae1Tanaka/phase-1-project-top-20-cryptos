# Phase-1 Project: Top 20 Cryptos Tracker

# Description

This project is a web application that tracks the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It is built using JavaScript and fetches data from the CoinCap API. The concept was inspired by [MarketCapOf](https://marketcapof.com).

The application provides functionalities such as:
- Viewing real-time data of the top 10 or 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap.
- Comparing two different cryptocurrencies' market caps.
- Showing the prices of a cryptocurrency if it had the same market cap as another crypto.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

1. Copy the SSH key from the clone.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Navigate to the folder in which you would like the repository to be placed.
4. Type `git clone` and then paste the SSH key after clone. It should look something like `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git`
5. Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

## Usage

On the page, you will see a table showing real-time data of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. You can click the "Show 10 More" button to view the next 10 cryptocurrencies. To compare two different cryptocurrencies' market caps, select two different cryptocurrencies from the dropdown list and click the "Compare" button. The result will be displayed below the button.
