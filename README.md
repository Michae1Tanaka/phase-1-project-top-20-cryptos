# Phase-1 Project: Top 20 Cryptos Tracker

# Description

This project is a web application that tracks the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It is built using JavaScript and fetches data from the CoinCap API. The concept was inspired by [MarketCapOf](https://marketcapof.com).

The application provides functionalities such as:
- Viewing real-time data of the top 10 or 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap.
- Comparing two different cryptocurrencies' market caps.
- Showing the prices of a cryptocurrency if it had the same market cap as another crypto.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

1. Copy the SSH key from the clone.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Navigate to the folder in which you would like the repository to be placed.
4. Type `git clone` and then paste the SSH key after clone. It should look something like `git clone https://github.com/Michae1Tanaka/phase-1-project-top-20-cryptos.git`
5. Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

## Usage

On the page, you will see a table showing real-time data of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. You can click the "Show 10 More" button to view the next 10 cryptocurrencies. To compare two different cryptocurrencies' market caps, select two different cryptocurrencies from the dropdown list and click the "Compare" button. The result will be displayed below the button.

## Contributors Guide

I encourage contributions to the Top 20 Cryptos Tracker project. Any help is appreciated. Here are some guidelines to follow if you plan on contributing:

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**: Start by following the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) portion of this README.md. Check that your fork is the "origin" remote with `git remote -v`. If you do not see an "origin" remote, you can add it using `git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/phase-1-project-top-20-cryptos.git`. Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

2. **Set Up Development Environment**: For this project, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

3. **Work on Your Own Feature or a Bug Fix**: Create a new branch in which you'll make changes. Use a descriptive name for your branch. Use `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`. Replace `BRANCH_NAME` with the descriptive title that would best describe what you will be doing.

4. **Make Changes in Your Local Repo**: Use a text editor or IDE of your choosing to make changes you planned to the files in your local repository. Here is a link for the one I personally use called [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

5. **Commit Your Changes**: After you make changes, use `git add .` to stage the changes made in the current directory you are in and use `git commit -m "DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES"` to commit them. Replace `"DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES"` with a brief description of the changes you have made.

6. **Push Your Changes to Your Fork**: When you are done making all of your changes, upload these changes to your fork using `git push origin BRANCH_NAME`. Replace `BRANCH_NAME` with the name of your branch.

7. **Begin the Pull Request**: Return to your fork on GitHub, and refresh the page. There should be a green button that says "Compare & pull request". Click it. If there isn't a "Compare & pull request" button, you can switch to your branch using the "Branch" button and then click "New pull request".

8. **Create the Pull Request**: When opening a "pull request", you are making a "request" that the project repository "pull" changes from your fork. Before submitting the pull request, you first need to describe the changes you made. Write a descriptive title for your pull request, and include more details in the body of the pull request. Once you are done, click the button that says "Create pull request".
